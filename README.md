This was a suggested takehome challenge. 

Skills that are highlighted:
- feature engineering
    - via residuals
    - via exhaustive recursive feature selection

- Models tried
    - Linear Regression
    - RandomForest

This problem is HARD. 

It certainly heated up my feature engineering skills!
